## Process

⚠️ **3D Secure
Visa Checkout implementation does not currently support 3DS. See 'Using 3D Secure with Visa Checkout' section of the 'Visa Checkout - Using the Simple Order API' if you are looking to implement this.**

⚠️ **Shipping Address
The shipping address should be acquired from Visa Checkout. This can be set via the `init` javascript:**

	V.init({
	  apikey: "...",
	  paymentRequest: {
	    currencyCode: "GBP",
	    subtotal: "..."
	  },
	  settings: {
	    shipping: {
	      collectShipping: "true",
	      acceptedRegions: ["GB"]
	    }
	  }
	});

**If this method of collecting the shipping address is not used, a shipping address should be set on the cart before authorizing payment.**  

1.  Create / prepare your cart
    
	a.  Ensure your cart locale is set.

2.  Create a commercetools payment
    (<https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-payments>) and
    populate the following
    
	|Property|Value|Required|Notes|
	|--- |--- |--- |--- |
	|customer|Reference to commercetools customer|See notes|Required for non-guest checkout. If using MyPayments API this will automatically be set to the logged in customer. One of customer or anonymousId must be populated|
	|anonymousId|Id for tracking guest checkout|See notes|Required for guest checkout. If using MyPayments API this will automatically be set. One of customer or anonymousId must be populated|
	|paymentMethodInfo.paymentInterface|isv_payments|Yes|Required for guest checkout. If using MyPayments API this will automatically be set to the session id of the anonymous oauth token. One of customer or anonymousId must be populated|
	|paymentMethodInfo.method|visaCheckout|Yes|The reference application is set up to support payments with and without payer authentication and the method is used to determine which is being used<br><br>Typically an implementation would choose one or the other and the method name may be different to this|
	|amountPlanned|Amount to authorise|Yes|Should match cart gross total, unless split payments are being used|
	|custom.fields.isv_token|Visa Checkout callid|Yes|Obtain from the 'callid' field on a successful Visa Checkout response|    

3.  Add the payment to the cart

4.  Add a transaction to the payment with the following values populated
    
    
	| Property | Value               | Notes                                 |
	| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
	| type     | Authorization       |                                       |
	| state    | Initial             |                                       |
	| amount   | Amount to authorise | Should match amountPlanned on payment |

    

5.  Verify the payment state
    
    a.  If the authorisation was successful the transaction state will have been updated to **Success**
    
    b.  See [Overview\#Errorhandling](Overview.md#Errorhandling) for handling errors or failures

6.  Convey the payment result to the customer. If this is the only/final payment for this order you can transition your commercetools cart to an order at this point
