# <a name="Configuration"></a>Configuration

There are a number of configuration variables that need to be defined before running the plugin. These can be set as environment variables inside the .env file present in the root directory of the plugin.

For multiple environments you should use unique values per environment.

## <a name="EnvironmentProperties"></a>Environment Properties

Variables that begin with 'CT' prefix are Commercetools project specific properties.
