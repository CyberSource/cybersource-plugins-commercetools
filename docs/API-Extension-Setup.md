# Configuration

There are a number of configuration variables that need to be defined before running the plugin. These can be set as environment variables inside the .env file present in the root directory of the plugin.

For multiple environments you should use unique values per environment.
For multiple environments you should use unique values per environment.

## Environment Properties

Variables that begin with 'CT' prefix are Commercetools project specific properties.

## Support for Multi-Mid

In this section mid refers to Cybersource Merchant Id. 

The new mid configurations should be added in the .env file of the plugin in the following format

      XXXX_KEY_ID = <Id of a Cybersource shared secret key>
      XXXX_SECRET_KEY = <Value of a Cybersource shared secret key>

Likewise you can configure, as many mids you want to support.

The mid added for `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_MERCHANT_ID` should be the default mid in which transactions will be processed when Multi-Mid is not enabled.

 Following are the constraints to be followed when you want to support multiple mids in your plugin instance.

      1. It is mandatory to provide the env variables for multi-mid in recommended format only.
      2. All env variables should be in block letters
      3. First part of the variable (XXXX) should be your Cybersource merchant Id in block letters
      4. Second part of the variable to store key Id should be _KEY_ID
      5. Second part of the variable to store secret key should be _SECRET_KEY

Example :
  
Below is the env variables for the mid which has merchant Id as `merchantid123`
  
      
      MERCHANTID123_KEY_ID = <Id of a Cybersource shared secret key>
      MERCHANTID123_SECRET_KEY = <Value of a Cybersource shared secret key>

Below is an example to set the value for PAYMENT_GATEWAY_DECISION_SYNC_MULTI_MID variable.

      PAYMENT_GATEWAY_DECISION_SYNC_MULTI_MID = merchantId1,merchantId2,merchantId3,...

For tokenization service i.e adding a card, updating a card and deleting a card in my account section, plugin will always consider default mid.
# Deployment

The Commercetools - Cybersource plugin is a typescript project which is built using cybersource-rest-client npm package and other several node packages.

> **_NOTE:_** You can view the loggers in src/loggers folder of the plugin if there are any information or errors found while processing the payments or configuring the plugin.

If you want serverless deployment of the plugin on AWS Lambda, refer [AWS-Serverless-Deployment\#AWSDeploymentSteps](AWS-Serverless-Deployment.md#AWSDeploymentSteps)

If you want serverless deployment of the plugin on AWS Lambda, refer [AWS-Serverless-Deployment\#AWSDeploymentSteps](AWS-Serverless-Deployment.md#AWSDeploymentSteps)

## Example deployment steps

The steps involved in deploying the Commercetools - Cybersource plugin in development environment are the following:

- Populate the .env file with the required data by referring to the values in the above given table
- Navigate to the root directory and run the following command to include the npm dependencies

      npm install

> **_NOTE:_** This is not necessary if the dependencies are already availabe in <b>node_modules</b> repository

- Run the following script to create the Commercetools extensions and custom fields

      npm run setup-resources

> **_NOTE:_** This can also be done by using `{baseUrl}/configurePlugin` endpoint once the server is started

- Run the following script to build the changes & running the plugin

      npm run start

> **_NOTE:_** It is necessary to build the entire plugin. Whenever there is a change and that need to be reflected, run the following script for building the application

      npm run build

### Run Unit Tests

Unit tests can be executed with the following command

	npm run cov
