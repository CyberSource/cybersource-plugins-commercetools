# Serverless Deployment

Serverless deployment is one of the latest trends in cloud technologies. It is a development model built for creating and running applications without the need for server management. They are provisioned, maintained and scaled by a third-party cloud provider, while the developers just write and deploy the code.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run virtually. You can run any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

## Pre-Requisites

Here is a list of pre-requisites that you need to have before proceeding with deployment:

- NodeJS and npm
- Active AWS account
- Active AWS subscription
- AWS credentials

## AWS Security Credentials

To connect the application to AWS account, you need to generate AWS Security Credentials. Follow below steps to generate security credentials

1. Login to your AWS account.

2. Go to your profile

   Security Credentials -> Access keys (access key ID and secret access key) -> Create New Access Key -> Download Key File

> **_NOTE:_** Download the credentials and keep it safe, since you won't be able to retrieve it again

3. The downloaded file contains `AWSAccessKeyId` and `AWSSecretKey`, use these credentials whenever required.

## Serverless Framework Services

The Serverless Framework is a command-line tool that uses easy and approachable `yml` syntax to deploy your code. A service is configured via `serverless.yml` file where you define your functions, the events that trigger them and the AWS resources to deploy. Each service configuration is managed in the serverless.yml file. You can see the name of the service and here you can provide your service name as per your convenience. The function inside the functions definition, it should point to `build/main/index.handler` since in index file we are wrapping our API for serverless use.

Create `serverless.yml` file having format as specified in [aws-deployment-sample.yml](./serverless-sample-yml/aws-deployment-sample.yml) file.

Replace value of

- `service-name` with any name. `service-name` is simply the name of your project
- `aws-region` with aws region of your choice which you want to use for lambda creation

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure to have correct indentation for each line in `serverless.yml` file. (Refer [Serverless.yml Reference](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml)). A sample of the same is available at [serverless-sample-yaml](./serverless-sample-yml/aws-deployment-sample.yml) file.

## Loggers in AWS Cloudwatch

In order to see the extension logs in Cloudwatch, console.log statement can be added inside the function `logData` in PaymentUtils.ts file. 

## Steps to Deploy Extension on AWS Lambda

1.  Navigate to the root directory and run the following command to include the npm dependencies

         npm install

> **_NOTE:_** This is not necessary if the dependencies are already available in <b>node_modules</b> folder

2.  Populate AWS security credentials (Refer [AWS Security Credentials](#aws-security-credentials)) and run the following command

         serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <your_aws_access_key_id> --secret <your_aws_access_key_secret>

3.  To deploy a service, run the below command in the same directory as [serverless.yml](#serverless-framework-services) i.e. root directory

         npm run deploy

4.  Once the deployment is done, to set/modify the env variables you have to login to your AWS account.
- Navigate to the lambda and click on the lambda function that has been created after successful deployment.
- Navigate to Configuration -> Environment variables and click on Add environment variable.
- Enter key and value for your env variable and click on save. (Refer [API-Extension-Setup](API-Extension-Setup.md#configuration))
    
    The execution role which will be created while deploying to AWS lambda will provide the credentials to lambda function which can be used to run and invoke other web services. Therefore, you don't need to provide AWS credentials in .env file.

 **_NOTE:_** If you need to have a public domain for your extension as that domain URL will be used to create API extensions, refer [Serverless-Api-Gateway-Domain](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-api-gateway-domain/) for more information

## Troubleshoot

1.  While deploying the application, if deployment is failed with an error message `Cannot read file due to EMFILE: too many open files`, you may have received this error because your system has certain limit to open files and that limit is reached. Deleting and re-installing the following files/folders may fix the issue:
 - .serverless
 - node-modules 
 - package-lock.json

2.  While configuring serverless with your AWS security credentials, sometimes you may get an error message as `The term 'serverless' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file or operable program`. Try installing serverless globally by entering command

         npm install -g serverless

If issue persist, try to configure serverless by opening the credentials file, which is typically located at ~/.aws/credentials. It may be a hidden file in your file browser. Your file may be an empty or may not even exist. If it doesnâ€™t exist create an empty file and paste your credentials in the below format 

          [default]
          aws_access_key_id=${Your access key ID}
          aws_secret_access_key=${Your secret access key}

3. If you are getting `Internal server error` while running sync service, increase the timeout of your API gateway to 30 seconds in serverless.yml file or in General Configuration of Lambda Function of AWS Console.
