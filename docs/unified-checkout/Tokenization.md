Commercetools provides the facility of customization of the `customer` resource. A token subscription can be created and saved while using the Card payment method (if provided).

The Customer update API extension will channel the request for Customer token creation, updation and deletion request coming from the front-end.

Use [API Extension Setup](API-Extension-Setup.md) guide for customizing the customer resource for saving tokens.

> **_NOTE:_** For tokenization service i.e., adding, updating and deleting a card data in my account section, extension will always consider default mid. So, its mandatory to use default mid in this case.

Merchant can display the customer tokens by querying the Customer using Customer Id. In My Account section, merchant will retrieve and display the saved card tokens for each customer from `custom.fields.isv_tokens` field, which contains a set of JSON object in string format. This information will be presented to the customer.

The customer saved tokens can be viewed in:

Merchant Centre → Customers → Customer list → Select a Customer → Custom Fields

# Tokenization with Microform

## Tokenize a card

1.  Tokenize Card details using Cybersource Microform v2

    a. If there are no cards available, update the customer by creating a custom type with the following

    | Property                                       | Value                        | Required |
    | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
    | custom.type.key                                | isv_payments_customer_tokens | Yes      |
    | custom.fields.isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature | empty string                 | Yes      |

    b. If there are tokens available already, update the customer by setting the following custom field

    | Property                                       | Value        | Required |
    | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
    | custom.fields.isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature | empty string | Yes      |

2.  The response should have the `isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature` and `isv_tokenVerificationContext` custom fields.
    Set the `isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature` custom field value to the captureContext of flex object which will load Cybersource Microform

            flexInstance = new Flex(captureContext);

3.  Use the Microform Integration v2 to tokenize card details. See <https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-flex-samples-node> for an example of how to use the captureContext obtained above and the Microform JS to tokenize a Card

4.  After the card details are entered by the customer, ask the customer to add billing address for the card and update the customer by populating the following

    | Property                              | Value                                            | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

5.  Wait for the updated response and verify the `custom.fields.isv_tokens` field

6.  If token is created successfully, `custom.fields.isv_tokens` field will have updated tokens along with `custom.fields.is_customerId` with the customer id returned in response.

7.  If there was an error, `custom.fields.isv_token`s field either be empty if there were no tokens available or will have the old tokens which were available before adding the new token. Also `custom.fields.isv_failedTokens` field will have all the failed card records if there was an error while adding the token

# Tokenization with UnifiedCheckout

1.  Use the client library asset path returned by the capture context response to invoke Unified Checkout on your page. To invoke the Unified Checkout JavaScript library using the JWT response from the capture context request, follow the instructions in the  document [Unified Checkout Setup](UnifiedCheckout-setup.md)

2.  After the payment process is completed by Customer, use the Token received from the Unified Checkout invoke call to populate the custom.fields.isv_transientToken field while updating customer.  If a merchant has opted to receive the billing and shipping information from the Customer, the same will be updated to the cart by plugin.


3. Update the Customer by populating the following fields

    | Property                              | Value                                            | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Update Card Details

1.  Update the customer with the new valid expiry month and year or an address for the card by populating the following

    Note that `isv_tokens` data is a set of JSON object strings and update the required data for the intended token while the other tokens remain untouched.

    A sample custom fields will look like this:

        "custom": {
            "type": {
                "typeId": "type",
                "id": "XXXXXXXXXXXX"

2.  If the token is updated successfully, the field `custom.fields.isv_tokenUpdated` will have the value true, else false

## Delete Card

1.  Update the customer by populating the following data

    Note that `isv_tokens` data is a set of JSON object strings and deletes the token information which is desired to be deleted while the other tokens remain untouched.

    A sample custom fields will look like this:

        "custom": {
            "type": {
                "typeId": "type",
                "id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
            },
            "fields": {
                "isv_tokens": [
                    "{\"alias\":\"Card XXXX\",\"value\":\"******************\",\"paymentToken\":\"******************\",\"instrumentIdentifier\":\"******************\",\"cardType\":\"XXX\",\"cardName\":\"XXX\",\"cardNumber\":\"411111XXXXXX1111\",\"cardExpiryMonth\":\"01\",\"cardExpiryYear\":\"20XX\"}",
                    "{\"alias\":\"Card XXXX\",\"value\":\"******************\",\"paymentToken\":\"******************\",\"instrumentIdentifier\":\"******************\",\"cardType\":\"XXX\",\"cardName\":\"XXX\",\"cardNumber\":\"555555XXXXXX4444\",\"cardExpiryMonth\":\"03\",\"cardExpiryYear\":\"20XX\"}"
                ]
            }
        }

2.  The response will have the updated data by removing the particular token that you intended to delete if the token is deleted successfully, else the tokens will remain untouched in the updated response.

## Customization in Tokenization

 Customer object has `isv_tokens` custom field which contains JSON string of tokens that are successfully saved in Cybersource, whereas the rest custom fields acts as a place holder to pass the data from Commercetools to extension. Once the card is processed successfully, the custom fields are cleaned up and `isv_tokens` will have the updated token information. 

For the actions of update/delete card it is mandatory to pass the required fields mentioned above to the extension. 

Below added few FAQ regarding tokenization.

1. Which token is being used when making a payment?

- While making a payment with saved card, we use the customer token and payment instrument

2. Which all are the tokens requested by the extension while saving a card?

- While saving a card, the extension requests 3 tokens which are Customer, Payment Instrument and Instrument Identifier.

3. I have a different customer data type than `isv_payments_customer_tokens` . How can I introduce tokenization in this case ?

- Commercetools platform doesn't allow more than one custom type for customer object at a time. So, if you want to support tokenization but a different custom type for customer object, you should make sure that your custom type should have all the custom fields required for tokenization as well. Please find the list of custom fields to be added to support tokenization [here](./Commercetools-Setup.md#customer-tokens). From the extension, the custom type key should be modified in Constants.ts file which is under the src folder as it is required for processing the tokens.
