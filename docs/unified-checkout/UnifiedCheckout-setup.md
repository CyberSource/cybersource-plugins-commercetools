# Unified Checkout

Unified Checkout provides a single interface with which you can accept numerous types of digital payments.

## Setting Up the Client Side

- To obtain the capture context, send a `GET` request to `{baseUrl}/captureContext`. This request requires authentication and must include an authentication header, which can be generated by making a `GET` request to `{baseUrl}/generateHeader`.

- Use the client library asset path returned by the capture context response to invoke Unified Checkout on your page.

    Get the JavaScript library URL dynamically from the capture context response. When decoded, it appears in the JSON parameter clientLibrary as:
    https://apitest.cybersource.com/up/v1/assets/x.y.z/SecureAcceptance.js

    When you load the library, the capture context that you received from your initial server‑side request is used to invoke the accept function.

    Example: Initializing the SDK

        <script src="https://apitest.cybersource.com/up/v1/assets/0.19.0/SecureAcceptance.js"></script>
        <script>
        Accept('header.payload.signature').then(function(accept) {
        // use accept object
        });
        </script>

    header.payload.signature refers to the capture context JWT


- Adding the Payment Application and Payment Acceptance

    After you initialize the Unified Checkout object, you can add the payment application and payment acceptance pages to your webpage. You can attach the Unified Checkout embedded tool and payment acceptance pages to any named element within your HTML. Typically, they are attached to explicit named `<div>` components that are replaced with Unified Checkout’s iframes.

  Example Setting Up with Full Sidebar:

        var authForm = document.getElementById("authForm");
        var transientToken = document.getElementById("transientToken");

        var cc = document.getElementById("captureContext").value;
        var showArgs = {
         containers: {
          paymentSelection: "#buttonPaymentListContainer"
        }
        };
        Accept(cc)
         .then(function(accept) {
         return accept.unifiedPayments();
         })
         .then(function(up) {
         return up.show(showArgs);
         })
         .then(function(tt) {
         transientToken.value = tt;
         authForm.submit();
         });

  Example Setting Up with the Embedded Component:
    
    The main difference between using an embedded component and the sidebar is that the accept.unifiedPayments object is set to false, and the location of the payment screen is passed in the containers argument.

        var authForm = document.getElementById("authForm");
        var transientToken = document.getElementById("transientToken");

        var cc = document.getElementById("captureContext").value;
        var showArgs = {
         containers: {
          paymentSelection: "#buttonPaymentListContainer",
          paymentScreen: "#embeddedPaymentContainer"
         }
        };
        Accept(cc)
         .then(function(accept) {
         // Gets the UC instance (e.g. what card brands I requested, any address information I pre-filled etc.)
         return accept.unifiedPayments(false);
         })
         .then(function(up) {
         // Display the UC instance
         return up.show(showArgs);
         })
        .then(function(tt) {
        // Return transient token from UC's UI to our app
        transientToken.value = tt;
        authForm.submit();
        }).catch(function(error) {
        //merchant logic for handling issues
        alert("something went wrong");
        });

## Decoding transient token

The response to a successful customer interaction with Unified Checkout is a transient token. The transient token is a reference to the payment data collected on your behalf. Tokens allow secure card payments to occur without risk of exposure to sensitive payment information. The transient token is issued as a JSON Web Token (JWT).When decoded, you can obtain the payment solution value from transientToken.content.processingInformation.paymentSolution.value. The payment solution values correspond to the following payment methods:

| Payment Solution value | Payment Method     
| -------- | ------------------- | 
| 012     | googlePay              |                                       
| 027    |  clickToPay            |                                       
| Default   | creditCard or creditCardWithPayerAuthentication (depending on the payerAuth flag) |
