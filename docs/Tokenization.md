# Tokenization

Commercetools provides the facility of customization of the `customer` resource. A token subscription can be created and saved when you use the Credit Card payment method (if provided).

The Customer update API extension will channel the request for Customer token creation, updation and deletion request coming from the front-end.

Use [API Extension Setup](API-Extension-Setup.md) guide for customizing the customer resource for saving tokens.

Merchant can display the customer tokens by querying the Customer using Customer Id. <b>custom.fields.isv_tokens</b> from Customer object will have the tokens saved for that Customer. custom.fields.isv_tokens data is a set of JSON object strings. Use these data and display it to the customer in My Account section.

The customer saved tokens can be viewed in:

Merchant Centre → Customers → Customer list → Select a Customer → Custom Fields

## Tokenize a card

1.  Tokenize credit card details using Cybersource Flex

    a. If there are no cards available, update the customer by creating a custom type with the following

    | Property                                       | Value                        | Required |
    | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
    | custom.type.key                                | isv_payments_customer_tokens | Yes      |
    | custom.fields.isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature | empty string                 | Yes      |

    b. If there are tokens available already, update the customer by setting the following custom field

    | Property                                       | Value        | Required |
    | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
    | custom.fields.isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature | empty string | Yes      |

2.  The response should have the `isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature` and `isv_tokenVerificationContext` custom fields, set the `isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature` custom field value to the captureContext of flex object which will load Cybersource Flex Microform

        flexInstance = new Flex(captureContext);

3.  Use the Flex Microform 0.11 to tokenize card details. See <https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-flex-samples-node> for an example of how to use the captureContext obtained above and the Flex Microform JS to tokenize a credit card

4.  After the card details are entered by the customer, ask the customer to add billing address for the card and update the customer by populating the following

    | Property                              | Value                                            | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

5.  Wait for the updated response and verify the custom.fields.isv_tokens field

6.  If token is created successfully, custom.fields.isv_tokens field will contain updated tokens

7.  If there was an error, custom.fields.isv_tokens field either be empty if there were no tokens available or will have the old tokens which were available before adding the new token. Also custom.fields.isv_failedTokens field will have all the failed card records if there was error while adding the token

## Update Card Details

1.  Update the customer with the new valid expiry date, month or an address for the card by populating the following

    Note that isv_tokens data is a set of JSON object strings and update the required data for the intended token while the other tokens remain untouched.

    A sample custom fields will look like this:

        "custom": {
            "type": {
                "typeId": "type",
                "id": "e1a79a4a-49d6-4153-a0e7-d434712c4448"
            },

## Delete Card

1.  Update the customer by populating the following data

    Note that isv_tokens data is a set of JSON object strings and delete the required data for the desired token while the other tokens remain untouched.

    A sample custom fields will look like this:

        "custom": {
            "type": {
                "typeId": "type",
                "id": "e1a79a4a-49d6-4153-a0e7-d434712c4448"
            },
            "fields": {
                "isv_tokens": [
                    "{\"alias\":\"Card 4111\",\"value\":\"******************\",\"paymentToken\":\"******************\",\"instrumentIdentifier\":\"******************\",\"cardType\":\"001\",\"cardName\":\"001\",\"cardNumber\":\"411111XXXXXX1111\",\"cardExpiryMonth\":\"01\",\"cardExpiryYear\":\"2025\"}",
                    "{\"alias\":\"Card 5444\",\"value\":\"******************\",\"paymentToken\":\"******************\",\"instrumentIdentifier\":\"******************\",\"cardType\":\"002\",\"cardName\":\"002\",\"cardNumber\":\"555555XXXXXX4444\",\"cardExpiryMonth\":\"03\",\"cardExpiryYear\":\"2025\"}"
