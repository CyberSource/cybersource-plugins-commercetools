# Decision Manager

## Field mapping

Fields which are used by Decision Manager are mapped from Commercetools fields as follows

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Resource</th>
<th>Field name</th>
<th>Cybersource field</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>firstName</td>
<td>shipTo_firstName</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>lastName</td>
<td>shipTo_lastName</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>streetNumber and streetName</td>
<td>shipTo_address1</td>
<td>If both fields have values they are concatenated with a space. Otherwise the value of the defined field is used</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>city</td>
<td>shipTo_city</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>postalCode</td>
<td>shipTo_postalCode</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>region</td>
<td>shipTo_state</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cart.shippingAddress</td>
<td>country</td>
<td>shipTo_country</td>
<td>2 letter ISO code</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>cart.lineItem[#]</td>
<td>quantity</td>
<td>item_#_quantity</td>
<td>Each line item in the cart is mapped</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cart.lineItem[#]</td>
<td>totalPrice</td>
<td>item_#_unitPrice</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>cart.lineItem[#]</td>
<td>name</td>
<td>item_#_productName</td>
<td>Name is a localise string property. We use the cart locale to decide which value to extract</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>cart.lineItem[#]</td>
<td>variant.sku</td>
<td>item_#_productSKU</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>payment</td>
<td>isv_deviceFingerprintId</td>
<td>deviceInformation_fingerprintSessionId</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Device fingerprinting

Follow the appropriate Cybersource guide for device fingerprinting and add the session id used for this to the Commercetools payment as a custom field called `isv_deviceFingerprintId`

### Enabling/disabling decision manager for specific payments

The Cybersource Plugin has environment variable for decision manager as PAYMENT_GATEWAY_DECISION_MANAGER, you can set the values to true or false to enable or disable decision manager

> **_NOTE:_** This field is case sensitive

## Optional fields

To pass additional data to Decision Manager it is possible to customize your Commercetools resources to add extra fields. If these fields exist and there are values present for these then the extension will pass the values on to Cybersource in the appropriate request

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Resource</th>
<th>Field name</th>
<th>Cybersource field</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>payment</td>
<td>isv_customerIpAddress</td>
<td>billTo_ipAddress</td>
<td><br />
</td>
</tbody>
</table>

### Sample definitions

#### Payment

The following is an example of field definitions for the customer IP address and a single merchant defined field. They would need to be added to the base field definitions and any other payment customizations you may already have

    {
      "fieldDefinitions": [
        {
          "type": {
            "name": "String"
          },
          "name": "isv_customerIpAddress",
          "label": {
            "en": "Customer IP address"
          },
          "required": false
        }
      ],
      "key": "isv_payment_data",
      "name": {
        "en": "ISV payment service custom payment fields"
      },
      "resourceTypeIds": [
        "payment"
      ]
    }

## Test settings

To support testing Decision Manager responses it is necessary to configure Decision Manager in EBC. This allows triggering of particular responses by matching line 1 of the billing address

- In Decision Manager → Configuration → Extended Settings enable
  Decision Manager for Authorization
  - Also ensure the reply flags are set to DREVIEW and DREJECT
- In Decision Manager → Configuration → Profiles create a new profile
  and set it as default
  - Disable the Threshold Rule Generator
  - Add an Accept rule with the condition 'Billing Street Address 1 is equal to "1 London Bridge"'
  - Add a Review rule with the condition 'Billing Street Address 1 is equal to "2 London Bridge"'
  - Add a Reject rule with the condition 'Billing Street Address 1 is equal to "3 London Bridge"'
