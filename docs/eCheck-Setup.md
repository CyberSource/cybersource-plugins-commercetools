# eCheck Setup

## eCheck

If you would like to support eCheck, you will need to register with one of these processors.

- Chase Paymentech Solutions
- Cybersource ACH Service
- TeleCheck

## Legal Compliance Text

Once you have registered with any of the processors above, to proceed with eCheck you might display the legal compliance text for Internet Check Acceptance Authorization. See the [Electronic Check services](https://developer.cybersource.com/docs/cybs/en-us/payments/developer/all/rest/payments/intro.html) document from the Cybersource Developer center.

Once the front office setup is ready to pass the required info for eCheck processing, you can continue to [Process a Payment (eCheck)](Process-a-Payment-eCheck.md) process.
