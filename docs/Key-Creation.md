Flex token generation uses a shared secret to generate one-time keys to be used when encrypting the user's credit card details on the client side and HTTP Signature authentication for Cybersource REST API services. Set up a secret as per [this guide](https://developer.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/REST_API/Getting_Started/Getting_Started_REST_API.pdf)<span> </span>and store the values safely. These should be provided in the API Extension's .env file as described in the [API Extension Setup](API-Extension-Setup.md) page.
