# Process a Payment (MOTO)

MOTO transactions are Mail order/telephone order transactions. As the name suggests, the transaction will be initiated by the Merchant on behalf of customer. The required order information along with the billing details and payments details are collected from the customer through mail or telephone.

For the Commercetools Extension to support MOTO transaction, follow the steps mentioned below.

## Details

1.  Prepare your cart

    a. Ensure the cart origin set to 'Merchant' (Refer documentation for more information <https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/carts#cartorigin>)

    b. Ensure your cart locale is set

    c. Ensure the cart billing and shipping addresses are set. The default mapping of Commercetools address fields to Cybersource fields is as follows

    > **_NOTE:_** : If the cart has multiple shipping methods, the shipping address of the first available shipping method applied to the cart will be used to process the payment

    | Commercetools address       | Cybersource shipping fields | Cybersource billing fields | Notes                                                                                                                |

2.  Tokenize Card details using Cybersource Microform v2.(Skip this step if the payment method is not Card Payment and proceed to step 4)

        Skip this step when using a saved token for a Card payment method and proceed to step 3

    a. Create a Commercetools payment (https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/payments) and populate the following

    | Property                           | Value                               | Required  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Populate this field with the value of merchant Id in which the transaction should happen. When this field is empty, default mid configuration will be considered for the transaction. The same mid will be used for the follow-on transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

    b. The response should have the `isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature` and `isv_tokenVerificationContext` custom fields, set the `isv_tokenCaptureContextSignature` custom field value to the captureContext of flex object which will load Cybersource Microform

        flexInstance = new Flex(captureContext);

    c. Use the Microform Integration V2 to tokenize card details. See <https://github.com/CyberSource/cybersource-flex-samples-node> for an example of how to use the captureContext obtained above and the Microform JS to tokenize a Card

3.  For saved token of a Card payment method, create a Commercetools payment (https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/payments) and populate the following
