### Merchant Setup
Before you can begin processing payments with PayPal Express Checkout, you must acquire PayPal
merchant credentials and provide them to Cybersource. Complete these tasks to link your PayPal
merchant account with your Cybersource merchant account:
-  Set up a PayPal business or premier account:

    https://www.paypal.com/us/business

-  Set up a PayPal Developer Account (Sandbox account for testing and Production account for live transactions).

-  Create your PayPal credentials by creating a PayPal app, as directed by the PayPal website:

   https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/#get-credentials

- Save the account facilitator email address, the client ID, and the secret key for future
  reference.

- Contact Cybersourcemerchant support and provide your PayPal credentials:

      ◦ Account facilitator email address
      ◦ Client ID
      ◦ Secret key

When your Cybersource account is set up, you can begin processing PayPal Express Checkout
payments
